# [How to start react app with typescript](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/adding-typescript)

## Creating an App

**You’ll need to have Node 8.10.0 or later on your local development machine** (but it’s not required on the server). You can use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm#installation) (macOS/Linux) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows#node-version-manager-nvm-for-windows) to easily switch Node versions between different projects.

To create a new app, you may choose one of the following methods:

### npx

```sh
npx create-react-app my-app
```

_([npx](https://medium.com/@maybekatz/introducing-npx-an-npm-package-runner-55f7d4bd282b) comes with npm 5.2+ and higher, see [instructions for older npm versions](https://gist.github.com/gaearon/4064d3c23a77c74a3614c498a8bb1c5f))_

### npm

```sh
npm init react-app my-app
```

Next, rename any file to be a TypeScript file (e.g. src/index.js to src/index.tsx) and restart your development server!

Type errors will show up in the same console as the build one.
